================================================================================
4. ENFORCEMENT AND LEGAL CONSEQUENCES
================================================================================

  (a) COPYRIGHT PROTECTION — This Software is protected under the
      Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. §§ 101-810), the Digital
      Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq.), the Berne
      Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
      the Canada Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42), and all
      applicable international copyright treaties and conventions.

  (b) MULTIPLE COPYRIGHTABLE WORKS — This Software comprises multiple
      independently copyrightable works, including but not limited to:
      icarus-math, icarus-field, icarus-gpu, icarus-engine, icarus-viz,
      icarus-mcp, icarus-bench, icarus-game, cortana-core, and
      cortana-mcp. EACH constitutes a separate "work" for purposes of
      copyright infringement claims. Any single act of infringement that
      encompasses multiple works gives rise to SEPARATE claims and
      SEPARATE damages awards for EACH work infringed.

  (c) STATUTORY DAMAGES — Willful infringement of this copyright may
      result in statutory damages of up to $150,000 PER WORK infringed
      (17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2)). As this Software contains a minimum of
      TEN (10) separately copyrightable works, a single act of willful
      infringement may result in statutory damages of up to
      $1,500,000 (ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS) or more,
      PLUS actual damages, lost profits, and complete disgorgement of
      the infringer's profits attributable to the infringement.

  (d) ACTUAL DAMAGES — UNCAPPED — In addition to or in lieu of statutory
      damages, the copyright holder may elect to recover ACTUAL DAMAGES
      suffered as a result of infringement, plus any profits of the
      infringer attributable to the infringement that are not taken into
      account in computing actual damages (17 U.S.C. § 504(b)). Actual
      damages are NOT CAPPED and may include: the full market value of
      the Software, licensing fees the infringer would have paid, revenue
      generated using the Software, consequential damages to the copyright
      holder's business, and any other provable harm.

  (e) LIQUIDATED DAMAGES — BY ACCESSING, VIEWING, DOWNLOADING, FORKING,
      CLONING, OR OTHERWISE OBTAINING A COPY OF THIS SOFTWARE, YOU
      ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:

        (i)   The novel algorithms, mathematical frameworks (including but
              not limited to the Leech lattice implementation, Extended
              Golay Code, reservoir computing architecture, emergent
              manifold computation, and emotion simulation engine),
              architectural designs, and engineering techniques embodied
              in this Software represent YEARS of original research and
              development with a replacement value that is difficult to
              calculate precisely;

        (ii)  In the event of ANY breach of this License — including but
              not limited to unauthorized copying, distribution,
              modification, commercial use, derivative work creation, or
              use for AI/ML training — you shall be liable for LIQUIDATED
              DAMAGES in the amount of ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000)
              per violation, which the parties agree represents a
              reasonable estimate of the minimum harm caused by such
              breach and is not a penalty;

        (iii) Each distinct act of infringement (each copy made, each
              distribution, each commercial deployment, each derivative
              work, each AI/ML training run) constitutes a SEPARATE
              VIOLATION subject to separate liquidated damages;

        (iv)  Liquidated damages are IN ADDITION TO (not in lieu of)
              statutory damages, actual damages, injunctive relief,
              criminal penalties, and all other remedies available at
              law or equity.

  (f) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION — The algorithms, data structures,
      mathematical proofs, architectural patterns, and engineering
      techniques contained in this Software constitute TRADE SECRETS
      under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836 et seq.)
      and applicable state Uniform Trade Secrets Acts. Misappropriation
      of these trade secrets may result in:

        (i)   Damages for actual loss and unjust enrichment
              (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(3)(B)(i));
        (ii)  EXEMPLARY DAMAGES of up to TWO TIMES (2x) the amount
              of actual damages for willful and malicious misappropriation
              (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(3)(C));
        (iii) Reasonable attorneys' fees (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(3)(D));
        (iv)  Criminal penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and
              $5,000,000 in fines for trade secret theft
              (18 U.S.C. § 1832).

  (g) CRIMINAL PENALTIES — Willful copyright infringement for commercial
      advantage or private financial gain is a federal crime punishable
      by up to 5 years imprisonment and $250,000 in fines
      (17 U.S.C. § 506, 18 U.S.C. § 2319). Repeat offenders face up
      to 10 years imprisonment. Criminal trade secret theft carries
      penalties of up to 10 years and $5,000,000 (18 U.S.C. § 1832).
      The copyright holder WILL refer willful infringers to the
      Department of Justice and the FBI Cyber Division for prosecution.

  (h) DMCA ENFORCEMENT — The copyright holder will pursue DMCA takedown
      notices (17 U.S.C. § 512) against ANY unauthorized copies,
      distributions, or derivative works found on ANY platform, hosting
      service, repository, package registry, or website, worldwide.
      Circumvention of technological protection measures is separately
      actionable under 17 U.S.C. § 1203, with statutory damages of up
      to $25,000 per act of circumvention.

  (i) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF — The copyright holder may seek IMMEDIATE
      temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and
      permanent injunctions to prevent ongoing or threatened
      infringement. You acknowledge that infringement would cause
      IRREPARABLE HARM for which monetary damages alone would be
      inadequate, and you consent to injunctive relief without the
      requirement of posting bond.

  (j) INTERNATIONAL ENFORCEMENT — The copyright holder will enforce
      this License in ALL jurisdictions worldwide, including but not
      limited to: the United States, Canada, the European Union, the
      United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and all signatories
      to the Berne Convention, TRIPS Agreement, and WIPO Copyright
      Treaty. Infringers may be subject to the laws and penalties of
      EVERY jurisdiction in which the infringement occurs or has effect.

  (k) INDEMNIFICATION — Any person or entity that breaches this License
      shall INDEMNIFY and HOLD HARMLESS the copyright holder against
      ALL costs, expenses, liabilities, and damages arising from
      enforcement, including but not limited to: attorneys' fees,
      expert witness fees, court costs, investigation costs, forensic
      analysis costs, and any damages awarded against the copyright
      holder in connection with enforcement proceedings.

  (l) ATTORNEYS' FEES — In any legal action arising from infringement
      of this License, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
      recover reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, and all
      litigation costs (17 U.S.C. § 505).

  (m) CUMULATIVE REMEDIES — ALL remedies under this Section 4 are
      CUMULATIVE and not exclusive. The copyright holder may pursue
      statutory damages, actual damages, liquidated damages, trade
      secret damages, DMCA damages, injunctive relief, criminal
      referral, and any other available remedy SIMULTANEOUSLY.
      Exercise of one remedy does not waive or preclude any other.

  (n) AGGREGATE EXPOSURE SUMMARY — For clarity, a single act of willful
      infringement involving the complete Software may expose the
      infringer to the COMBINED total of:
        - Statutory damages:     up to $1,500,000+ (10 works × $150,000)
        - Liquidated damages:    $1,000,000+ per violation
        - Trade secret damages:  uncapped actual + 2x exemplary
